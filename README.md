# location-musica
A fun summer project for a new style of music player, where the users current playing music is determined by their location. I'll be documenting everthing done related to this project on the repository and have links below to wireframes, code-bases, ideas, issues and more. 

If you wish to contribute in anyway, feel free to create a pull_request.
